# Progress-Tracker

## Short introduction to the project

Welcome to my project repository for my webapp: Progress-Tracker. \
This project will be one of my most advanced and well developed project so far.

Bellow there will be a short description of what this project will become, and a meta explanation of why I am developing this project. \
After that there is a short explanation of how to navigate this project.

## The "Why", of the project

This project will be a MERN-stack website for planing and tracking your progress. Firstly, the plan is to make the website for tracking workout progress, but I might add tracking for other areas of productivity. \
There are multiple apps that try to do the same. But they either lack the functionalitys that i seek, or they cost monney. So I wanted to make my own that works exactly the way I want It to. \
That is the short version, if you want the longer description of what the project will become, take a look at the explanation of the [Problem](/log/Problem.md) that this project intends to solve.

The other side of the reason why I am making this project, is that I want to learn and practice. I want to learn more about developing Fullstack web-apps, which I want to practice, by using the MERN-stack. The other thing is that I want to practice good development and coding practices. Which is why I will document all interesting facets of this project, in a way that is intuitive for others and reflects the prosess of developing this project from scratch, including what is not explicitly included in the code.

## How to navigate the project
The [code folder](/code) contains all the main code needed for this project. If I wherent going to add all the documentation for this project that I am planing, this folder would insted be the whole repository. The code is seperated in to two parts. \
The [server](/code/server/) (the backend) of the app \
and the [client](/code/client) (the frontend) of the app.

The [docs folder](/docs) contains documentation for how to use the project. \
The [user docs](/docs/user_docs/) explains how to use the web app. So if you have oppend the webapp and dont know how to use it, you should look at that folder. \
The [dev docs](/docs/dev_docs/) explains how the code works, so if you need help understanding how the code works overall, you should look at that folder.

The [log folder](/log/) contains all documens describing the overall process of developing this projct. \
The [feature-log](/log/feature-log/) contains a chronological log of the project, where each log describes the development of a feature. \
The [overview](/log/overview/) describes more of the overall process of the project. The overview has tre parts: \
The [problem](/log/overview/Problem.md), which describes the real world problem which this project intends to solve and how tis project intends to solve that problem. \
The [prosess](/log/overview/Prosess.md) will describe interesting hurdles in the developmentprosess, how they where solved and what was learned as a result of overcomming the hurdle. \
Lastly the [solution](/log/overview/Solution.md) will takes look at the final version of the project and reflect on how it solves the initial problem. Aswell as some overall reflections. Obviously, this part wont be writen until the project is done.

The [testing folder](/testing/) is for testing of the code in the project. It contains unit-test for the code, to test if it is working as intended. 

## Thanks

Thanks for taking a look at this project. I hope it has been usefull to you in some way.
