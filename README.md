# Progress-Tracker
Welcome to my Progress-Tracker project repo. \
This project will be one of my most advanced and well developed project.

Bellow there will be a short description of what this project will become, and a meta explanation of why I am developing this project. \
After that there is a short explanation of how to navigate this project.

# The "Why", of the project

This project will be a MERN-stack website for planing and tracking your progress. Firstly, the plan is to make the website for tracking workout progress, but I might add tracking for other areas of productivity. \
There are multiple apps that try to do the same. But they either lack the functionalitys that i seek, or they cost monney. So I wanted to make my own that works exactly the way I want It to. \
That is the short version, if you want the longer description of what the project will become, take a look at the explanation of the [Problem](/log/Problem.md) that this project intends to solve.

The other side of the reason why I am making this project, is that I want to learn and practice. I want to learn more about developing Fullstack web-apps, which I want to practice, by using the MERN-stack. The other thing is that I want to practice good development and coding practices. Which is why I will document all interesting facets of this project, in a way that is intuitive for others and reflects the prosess of developing this project from scratch, including what is not explicitly included in the code.
