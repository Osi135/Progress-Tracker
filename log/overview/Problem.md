# Problem

## Why there are no other products like this.

There is a quote that goes "What gets messured, gets done" The origins of the quote is somewhat debated, but that is not whats important here. Point is that I experience that it is the case that it is easyer to do more progress, if you track it. \
That is for the most part why I use a workout app when I work out. After having dowloaded, tried and deleted many workout-apps, I havent found one that perfectly fits my needs. I have found one that I preffer over the others, but I still see improvement potensiall inn it. \
So, what is the problem with the workout-apps i deleted. To mention some:
- Lack of customisation of exercises.
- To much focus on premade exercises and to litle of selfmade exercises.
- Not posible to change exercises during a workout.
- Either focus on strength, stretching/yoga or running, and if the app has functionality for all, one of the areas of workout lacks in functionality.
- Not posible to view statistics of your previous workout or if it is posible, the different ways of viewing workout statistics is limited.
- Not posible to set goals.
- If the app has some of the features mentioned above, or other usefull features, they are behind a paywall.

## Spessifying what this product will become.

So, exactly what will the features of this product be. Bellow is the intended minimum features for the project to be considerd completed, but I migt make more features if I deem them as necessary in realation to the resourcess it would take to make it. \
The core features:
- Profile you can access from any device.
- Create workouts of any type(weights, body-weight, endurance, yoga, jogging) in advance, or on the spot.
- Perform, track and change workouts.
- View usefull statisctics of previous workouts and overall progress.
- For a given exercise, it can have the following parameters: reps, sets, rest, weight, body-weight-percent, muscle, exercise type, time, distance, length (stretching). And all those variables can be set, changed during workout, be variables in statistics and be goals. Also, everythin that is timed, both exercises and rest has togglage auto-start.
- UI, fitted for both phone and computer.
- Pritty, simple and intuitive UI.
- Presset database of exercisess with detaild info, to change and add to workouts.

Those are the minimum necessary features, but when I begin using the web-app myself, if I find that the web-app lacks some functionality that I se usefull, I will add them.

## Thechnologi choise

To make this web-app, I am using the MERN stack with typescript. MERN is an achronym for:
MongoDB Atlas as a cloud-based Database.
Express.js providin API enpoints in backend.
React.js on the client.
Node.js running the server.
The MERN-stack great for quick development. It also uses only javascript across the entire stack, but you can use typescript in place of javascript.
I use the MERN-stack because of its easy development, and I have some experience with it. I use typescript to get type-safty, and I don't have experience with it, so I want to learn it.
